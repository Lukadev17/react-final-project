In Japanese, anime, a term derived from the English word animation, describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin. Outside of Japan, anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan, or to its common style, which has since been adopted by a minority of works produced in other countries.[1] The earliest commercial Japanese animations date to 1917. A characteristic art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka and spread in following decades, developing a large domestic audience. Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. In addition to original works, anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light novels, or video games. It is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche audiences. Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent technologies. It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques.[2] Compared to Western animation, anime production generally focuses less on movement, and more on the detail of settings and use of \"camera effects\", such as panning, zooming, and angle shots.[2] Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and features can be quite varied, with a common characteristic feature being large and emotive eyes.[3] The anime industry consists of over 430 production companies, including major studios like Studio Ghibli, Sunrise, and Toei Animation. Since the 1980s, the medium has also seen international success with the rise of foreign dubbed and subtitled programming. As of 2016, Japanese anime accounted for 60% of the world's animated television Animation in Japan began in the early 20th century, when filmmakers started to experiment with techniques pioneered in France, Germany, the United States, and Russia.[10] A claim for the earliest Japanese animation is Katsud\u014d Shashin (c.\u20091907),[14] a private work by an unknown creator.[15] In 1917, the first professional and publicly displayed works began to appear; animators such as \u014cten Shimokawa, Seitar\u014d Kitayama, and Jun'ichi K\u014duchi (considered the \"fathers of anime\") produced numerous films, the oldest surviving of which is K\u014duchi's Namakura Gatana.[16] Many early works were lost with the destruction of Shimokawa's warehouse in the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake.[17] By the mid-1930s animation was well-established in Japan as an alternative format to the live-action industry. It suffered competition from foreign producers, such as Disney, and many animators, including Nobur\u014d \u014cfuji and Yasuji Murata, continued to work with cheaper cutout animation rather than cel animation.[18] Other creators, including Kenz\u014d Masaoka and Mitsuyo Seo, nevertheless made great strides in technique, benefiting from the patronage of the government, which employed animators to produce educational shorts and propaganda.[19] In 1940, the government dissolved several artists' organizations to form the Shin Nippon Mangaka Ky\u014dkai.[a][20] The first talkie anime was Chikara to Onna no Yo no Naka (1933), a short film produced by Masaoka.[21][22] The first feature-length anime film was Momotaro: Sacred Sailors (1945), produced by Seo with a sponsorship from the Imperial Japanese Navy.[23] Momotaro: Sacred Sailors (1945), the first feature-length anime film The 1950s saw a proliferation of short, animated advertisements made in Japan for television broadcasting.[24] In the 1960s, manga artist and animator Osamu Tezuka adapted and simplified many Disney animation techniques to reduce costs and limit frame counts in his productions.[25] He originally intended these as temporary measures to allow him to produce material on a tight schedule with an inexperienced staff, though many of his limited animation practices would later come to define the medium's style.[26] Three Tales (1960) was the first anime film broadcast on television;[27] the first anime television series was Instant History (1961\u201364).[28] An early and influential success was Astro Boy (1963\u201366), a television series directed by Tezuka based on his manga of the same name. Many animators at Tezuka's Mushi Production would later establish major studios (such as Madhouse, Sunrise, and Pierrot). The 1970s saw growth in the popularity of manga, many of which were later animated. Tezuka's work\u2014and that of other pioneers in the field\u2014inspired characteristics and genres that remain fundamental elements of anime today. The giant robot genre (also known as \"mecha\"), for instance, took shape under Tezuka, developed into the super robot genre under Go Nagai and others, and was revolutionized at the end of the decade by Yoshiyuki Tomino, who developed the real robot genre.[29] Robot anime series such as Gundam and Super Dimension Fortress Macross became instant classics in the 1980s, and the genre remained one of the most popular in the following decades.[30] The bubble economy of the 1980s spurred a new era of high-budget and experimental anime films, including Nausica\xe4 of the Valley of the Wind (1984), Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honn\xeaamise (1987), and Akira (1988).[31] Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995), a television series produced by Gainax and directed by Hideaki Anno, began another era of experimental anime titles, such as Ghost in the Shell (1995) and Cowboy Bebop (1998). In the 1990s, anime also began attracting greater interest in Western countries; major international successes include Sailor Moon and Dragon Ball Z, both of which were dubbed into more than a dozen languages worldwide. In 2003, Spirited Away, a Studio Ghibli feature film directed by Hayao Miyazaki, won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards. It later became the highest-grossing anime film,[b] earning more than $355 million. Since the 2000s, an increased number of anime works have been adaptations of light novels and visual novels; successful examples include The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and Fate/stay night (both 2006).shows.[4]to ge dynamism with aggression to produce a cutting edge carbon fiber monocoque.
